what is oops?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

for eg:In real world human is object and it has behavior(act or interact) and some attribute(brain,hand,walking).
