what is oops?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

for eg:In real world human is object and it has behavior(act or interact) and some attribute(brain,hand,walking).

What is the structure of object-oriented programming?

○ Classes : user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.

○ Object :  instances of a class created with specifically defined data.

○ Methods : Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.

○ Attributes : . Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.
