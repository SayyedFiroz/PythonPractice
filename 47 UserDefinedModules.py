# User Defined Module :You can create your own functions and classes, put them inside modules, You can now include hundreds of lines of code into any program just by writing a simple import statement.

# We create user defined module to break the project into multi parts or reuse that module when we needed.

# we are importing functions from calc fil


from Calc import *


a= 2
b= 3

c = add(a,b)
d = div(a,b)

print(d)
print(c)
